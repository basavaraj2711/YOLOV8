# Vehicle Detection and Traffic Signal Optimization using YOLOv8

## Introduction

This project leverages YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8), a state-of-the-art deep learning model for real-time vehicle detection and traffic signal optimization. By dynamically adjusting traffic signals based on real-time vehicle density, the system aims to enhance urban traffic management and reduce congestion, fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions.

## Motivation

1. Enhance traffic management through real-time vehicle counting and signal adjustments.
2. Minimize traffic congestion and its associated environmental impact.
3. Improve safety by reducing accidents caused by inefficient signal control.
4. Provide a scalable solution for urban transportation systems.

## Problem Statement

To develop a real-time vehicle detection and counting system using YOLOv8 for analyzing traffic patterns and dynamically optimizing traffic signals, thereby improving overall traffic flow at intersections.

## Objectives

1. Detect and classify vehicles in real-time from live video feeds.
2. Preprocess datasets for training and standardize input data.
3. Train and optimize the YOLOv8 model for high accuracy.
4. Evaluate performance in traffic detection and signal adjustment.
5. Measure the impact on traffic management efficiency.

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Process images and video feeds with a latency of less than two seconds.
- Detect and classify vehicles accurately in real-time.
- Calculate vehicle density per lane and update traffic signals accordingly.
- Display real-time vehicle counts, traffic density, and signal status.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability to handle multiple intersections.

## System Architecture

The system uses the following components:
1. **Backbone**: Extracts feature maps using convolutional and residual layers.
2. **Neck (C2f Module)**: Fuses feature maps at different scales and integrates contextual information.
3. **Head**: Predicts bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class probabilities.
4. **Loss Function**: Optimizes model training.

---

## Design Principles and Patterns

- **Composite Pattern**: Backbone and Head are built using reusable blocks like CSP (C2f), Bottleneck, and SPPF.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Incorporates Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to filter low-confidence and overlapping bounding boxes.

## Algorithm

1. Input: Image or video frame.
2. Preprocess image: Resize and normalize.
3. Backbone: Extract feature maps.
4. Neck: Fuse feature maps and integrate context.
5. Head: Predict bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class probabilities.
6. Apply NMS: Filter results based on confidence and IoU threshold.
7. Output: Bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Development Tools**: Ultralytics YOLO library for YOLOv8.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Pillow (PIL) and OpenCV.
- **Programming Language**: Python.
